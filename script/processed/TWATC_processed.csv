,speech,Madison,"When you have the chance to work on a living author, you want to meet him, it's normal. To know him a little better. And by knowing about his life, it provides a better understanding of his work.",neutral,neutral,neutral
,speech,Alexandre,"It's a mistake, I assure you. It's better to be content with studying the work while ignoring everything about the author. Many great writers were very small characters in life. If they weren't complete assholes. And that goes either artists or scientists. That's how it is. Geniuses rarely benefit from being known... Even though, I don't consider myself a genius...",neutral,annoyance,neutral
,speech,Madison,"I understand your modesty, but still... An exclusive interview with the author of ""Chronicles of the Latin Quarter"" would be the crowning achievement of my research.",neutral,admiration,neutral
,speech,Alexandre,Have you read it?,neutral,curiosity,neutral
,speech,Madison,It's this novel that convinced me to come and study in Paris. I consider it as your best book.,joy,admiration,joy
,speech,Alexandre,"However, it is not the best-selling...",neutral,disapproval,neutral

,speech,Alexandre,"I don't write anything at all. It is a legend maintained by my publisher so that I am not completely forgotten, and my old books continue to 10 sell a bit.

,speech,Madison,No!,anger,disapproval,anger
,consigne,,He seems surprised at her determination.,,,
,speech,Alexandre,"What do you mean, no?",surprise,confusion,surprise
,speech,Madison,I won't let you commit suicide before granting me this interview. I could have swum across the Atlantic to get it!,anger,neutral,anger

,speech,Alexandre,"I have a feeling that you are going to suggest that I get a cat... Do you want to get rid of yours, is that it? 11",neutral,neutral,disgust
,speech,Madison,Doesn't loneliness weigh on you at all?,neutral,curiosity,neutral
,speech,Alexandre,"Loneliness... It's like coffee... At first, it's a little bitter. Then you get used to it. After that, you develop a taste for it. And finally, we can't do without it.",disgust,sadness,neutral
,speech,Madison,You should write a collection of aphorisms. I'm sure it would sell very well.,neutral,approval,neutral
,speech,Alexandre,"And then what is it, not being alone? Living as a couple and rehashing the same banalities year after year? Seeing family or friends from time to time, carefully avoiding any important topics that could cause conflict? Running into neighbors in the stairwell and discussing the weather? Talking to your cat as if it understands you?",neutral,neutral,neutral
,speech,Madison,"Yet, when you write, however, you are addressing someone.",neutral,neutral,neutral
,speech,Alexandre,That's exactly why I stopped writing.,sadness,neutral,sadness

,speech,Madison,Yes... But it could end soon...,sadness,approval,sadness
,speech,Alexandre,What do you mean?,surprise,confusion,surprise
,speech,Madison,I have a heart disease. Doctors have given me only a few years to live. Maybe just a few months. That's why I came to France to fulfill one last dream. To meet you...,sadness,desire,neutral

,speech,Alexandre,What do you mean by heart disease?,surprise,confusion,neutral

,speech,Alexandre,"And on top of that, you're still smiling...",joy,joy,neutral
,speech,Madison,I tell myself that the remaining months of my life might be the most beautiful ones in my existence.,joy,admiration,joy
,speech,Alexandre,Your joy of life depresses me. Do you ever doubt?,joy,sadness,joy
,speech,Madison,I don't have time for doubt anymore. That's why I forced your door...,fear,neutral,neutral
,consigne,,A pause.,,,
,speech,Alexandre,And there is really no hope?,surprise,confusion,sadness
,speech,Madison,"Yes, a transplant. Still I need to find a donor...",sadness,neutral,neutral
,speech,Alexandre,"I could offer you my heart, I no longer have any use for it... I commit suicide, and I donate my organs to you...",sadness,sadness,sadness

,speech,Alexandre,"I heard that in China, they take organs from death row inmates. It's much more convenient, obviously. They set the transplantation date and execute the inmate on the same day.",neutral,neutral,neutral
,speech,Madison,But that's terrible...,fear,fear,sadness
,speech,Alexandre,"Yes, but that way... the recipient has enough time to leisurely fly in from Europe or the United States. Some even take the opportunity to do some sightseeing. Of course, it's not free. I don't know how much a heart costs in China. Have you looked into it?",neutral,confusion,neutral
,speech,Madison,No...,neutral,neutral,neutral
,speech,Alexandre,You should be able to find that easily on the internet...,neutral,neutral,neutral
,speech,Madison,Thank you.,neutral,gratitude,neutral
,speech,Alexandre,"I'm sorry, I shouldn't joke about it... especially not with you. But then again, humor is all we have left, isn't it?",neutral,remorse,neutral

,speech,Alexandre,It is indeed on this machine that I wrote all my novels. But don't try to trap me. I told you that I haven't written for years.,neutral,neutral,neutral
,speech,Madison,Why?,surprise,neutral,surprise
,speech,Alexandre,"Words are like banknotes, if you put too many of them in circulation, they lose their value... Look at what's happening on social media today. Everyone is sharing their little thoughts ten or twenty times a day. On every topic. An inflation of fake currency that has devalued the real one. Words no longer mean anything.",neutral,neutral,disgust
,speech,Madison,"You can't stop people from chatting. Before, it was at the café, today it's on Facebook. But there will always be great authors, like you.",neutral,admiration,neutral
,speech,Alexandre,Great authors are no longer read. They are quoted. Incorrectly and indiscriminately. The same quotes repeated over and over until they are completely emptied of meaning... Copy and paste has replaced thinking... and emojis have replaced emotions.,neutral,disapproval,neutral
,speech,Madison,May I quote you in the conclusion of my thesis?,neutral,curiosity,neutral
,speech,Alexandre,"I will be accused of elitism. They'll say that only a select few have the right to express themselves, and that the rest should just keep quiet and listen. That's not true. I believe we should all be quiet.",neutral,disapproval,anger
,speech,Madison,What do you suggest? A minute of silence ?,neutral,curiosity,neutral
,speech,Alexandre,Not just a minute. A whole year. A century. A millennium of silence. Maybe then our words would regain meaning after the verbal diarrhea that has flooded social media in recent years.,neutral,neutral,neutral
,speech,Madison,"It's an interesting analysis, but it's also said that you stopped writing because of a broken heart?",sadness,curiosity,surprise
,speech,Alexandre,People say what we want...,neutral,neutral,neutral
